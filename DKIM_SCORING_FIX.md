# DKIM Scoring Fix

## Issue Description

The DKIM Records component was showing incorrect scoring in the "Score Breakdown" section, displaying `25/20 pts` instead of the correct maximum score of 20 points.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by hardcoded values in the old scoring system in `backend/app.py` that were inconsistent with the new scoring structure:

1. **DKIM Base Score**: Was set to 25 points instead of 20 points
2. **DMARC Base Score**: Was set to 25 points instead of 30 points
3. **Scoring Comments**: Outdated comments referenced "25 points each" for all components

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Updated DKIM Scoring in `backend/app.py`**

**Before:**
```python
if dkim_result['has_dkim']:
    score += 25
    scoring_details['dkim_base'] = 25
```

**After:**
```python
if dkim_result['has_dkim']:
    score += 20
    scoring_details['dkim_base'] = 20
```

### 2. **Updated DMARC Scoring in `backend/app.py`**

**Before:**
```python
if dmarc_result['has_dmarc']:
    score += 25
    scoring_details['dmarc_base'] = 25
```

**After:**
```python
if dmarc_result['has_dmarc']:
    score += 30
    scoring_details['dmarc_base'] = 30
```

### 3. **Fixed Scoring Comments**

**Before:**
```python
Base Scoring (100 points total):
- MX Records: 25 points (essential for email delivery)
- SPF Records: 25 points (prevents email spoofing)
- DMARC Records: 25 points (authentication reporting)
- DKIM Records: 25 points (email authentication)

# Base scoring (25 points each)
```

**After:**
```python
Base Scoring (100 points total):
- MX Records: 25 points (essential for email delivery)
- SPF Records: 25 points (prevents email spoofing)
- DMARC Records: 30 points (authentication reporting)
- DKIM Records: 20 points (email authentication)

# Base scoring (MX: 25, SPF: 25, DMARC: 30, DKIM: 20)
```

### 4. **Fixed Email Template Scoring Display**

**Before:**
```python
Score: {scoring_details.get('dkim_base', 0)}/25
```

**After:**
```python
Score: {scoring_details.get('dkim_base', 0)}/20
```

### 5. **Fixed Hardcoded Default Values**

**Before:**
```python
"dmarc_base": 25,
```

**After:**
```python
"dmarc_base": 30,
```

## Updated Scoring Structure

The corrected scoring structure now properly reflects:

| Component | Base Score | Max Score | Description |
|-----------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| MX Records | 25 | 25 | Essential for email delivery |
| SPF Records | 25 | 25 | Prevents email spoofing |
| DMARC Records | 30 | 30 | Authentication reporting |
| DKIM Records | 20 | 20 | Email authentication |
| **Total** | **100** | **100** | **Base Score Total** |
| Bonus Points | Up to 10 | Up to 10 | Additional configurations |
| **Final Total** | **Up to 110** | **Capped at 100** | **Final Score** |

## Frontend Display

The frontend now correctly displays:

```
MX Records: 25/25 pts
SPF Records: 25/25 pts
DMARC Records: 30/30 pts
DKIM Records: 20/20 pts
```

With bonus points shown as separate green indicators:
```
MX Records: 25/25 pts +2 Bonus
SPF Records: 25/25 pts +1 Bonus
DMARC Records: 30/30 pts +3 Bonus
DKIM Records: 20/20 pts +2 Bonus
```

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Test Domain**: `predikly.com`
2. **Expected Result**: DKIM Records should show `X/20 pts` instead of `X/25 pts`
3. **Total Score**: Should properly calculate based on 100-point base system

## Files Modified

1. **`backend/app.py`**:
   - Updated DKIM base score from 25 to 20
   - Updated DMARC base score from 25 to 30
   - Fixed scoring comments and documentation
   - Updated email template scoring display
   - Fixed hardcoded default values

2. **`backend/scoring_engine.py`**:
   - Already had correct DKIM scoring logic
   - Properly separates base and bonus scores

3. **`frontend/src/App_fixed.js`**:
   - Fixed hardcoded DKIM scoring from `/25` to `/20`
   - Fixed hardcoded DMARC scoring from `/25` to `/30`

4. **`frontend/src/App_original.js`**:
   - Fixed hardcoded DKIM scoring from `/25` to `/20`
   - Fixed hardcoded DMARC scoring from `/25` to `/30`

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Correct scoring display builds trust
- **Accuracy**: Scoring now matches industry standards
- **Consistency**: All components use the same scoring framework
- **Transparency**: Users can see accurate point allocations

## Future Considerations

1. **Migration**: Consider migrating fully to the new scoring engine
2. **Validation**: Add unit tests for scoring calculations
3. **Documentation**: Keep scoring documentation updated
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor for any scoring discrepancies
