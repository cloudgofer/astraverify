# Email Configuration Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Solved
The error "Failed to send email: Failed to send email from localhost:3000" was caused by the frontend using the wrong backend URL configuration.

## Root Cause
- Frontend was configured to use staging backend (`https://astraverify-backend-staging-ml2mhibdvq-uc.a.run.app`)
- Local backend was running on `http://localhost:8080`
- Email password was properly configured on backend
- Frontend couldn't reach the local backend for email requests

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Frontend Configuration
Switched frontend to use local backend configuration:
```bash
cd frontend/src
cp config.local.js config.js
```

### 2. Created Configuration Management Tools

#### Config Switcher Script
```bash
./switch_config.sh [local|staging|production|status]
```

**Usage:**
- `./switch_config.sh local` - Switch to local development
- `./switch_config.sh staging` - Switch to staging environment  
- `./switch_config.sh production` - Switch to production environment
- `./switch_config.sh status` - Show current configuration

#### Email Setup Script
```bash
./setup_local_email.sh
```
This script helps set up the EMAIL_PASSWORD environment variable for local development.

### 3. Email Configuration Details

**SMTP Settings:**
- Server: `smtp.dreamhost.com`
- Port: `587`
- Username: `hi@astraverify.com`
- Authentication: TLS

**Environment Variable:**
```bash
export EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-actual-password"
```

## Testing

### Test Email Configuration
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/test-email | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Test Email Report Functionality
```bash
python3 backend/test_email_local.py
```

## Current Status

✅ **Backend**: Running on localhost:8080 with email configured  
✅ **Frontend**: Configured to use local backend  
✅ **Email**: Working correctly with clickable domain links  
✅ **Domain Links**: Implemented in email reports  

## Email Report Features

The email reports now include:
- **Clickable Domain Links**: Domain names are clickable hyperlinks
- **Environment-Aware URLs**: 
  - Local: `http://localhost:3000?domain={domain}`
  - Production: `https://astraverify.com?domain={domain}`
  - Staging: `https://astraverify-frontend-staging-ml2mhibdvq-uc.a.run.app?domain={domain}`
- **Enhanced Styling**: Blue links with hover effects
- **Direct Access**: Links pre-fill the domain for easy analysis

## Quick Commands

### For Local Development
```bash
# Switch to local config
./switch_config.sh local

# Set email password
export EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-password"

# Start services
./run_local.sh
```

### For Testing
```bash
# Test email configuration
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/test-email

# Test email report functionality
python3 backend/test_email_local.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Email Still Fails
1. Check if EMAIL_PASSWORD is set: `echo $EMAIL_PASSWORD`
2. Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/health`
3. Check frontend config: `./switch_config.sh status`
4. Restart services if needed

### If Frontend Can't Connect
1. Ensure backend is running on port 8080
2. Check frontend config points to localhost:8080
3. Restart frontend development server

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/config.js` - Updated to use local backend
- `backend/app.py` - Enhanced email reports with clickable domain links
- `backend/app.py.backup` - Updated backup with same enhancements
- `switch_config.sh` - New script for managing configurations
- `setup_local_email.sh` - New script for email setup
- `backend/test_email_local.py` - New test script

## Next Steps

1. **For Development**: Use `./switch_config.sh local` before starting development
2. **For Production**: Use `./switch_config.sh production` before building
3. **For Staging**: Use `./switch_config.sh staging` for staging environment

The email functionality is now fully working with enhanced features including clickable domain links in email reports!
