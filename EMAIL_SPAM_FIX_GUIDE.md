# Email Spam Filter Fix Guide

## Problem Identified
DreamHost was blocking emails as spam, causing emails to be sent successfully but not delivered to recipients.

## Root Cause
Email providers use sophisticated spam filters that can block legitimate emails based on various factors:
- Missing or suspicious email headers
- Content that looks like spam
- New domain reputation
- Missing authentication records
- Suspicious sending patterns

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Email Headers
Added proper email headers to improve deliverability:

```python
# Add anti-spam headers
msg['Message-ID'] = f'<{domain}-{int(datetime.now().timestamp())}@astraverify.com>'
msg['Date'] = datetime.now().strftime('%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z')
msg['X-Mailer'] = 'AstraVerify Email System'
msg['X-Priority'] = '3'
msg['X-MSMail-Priority'] = 'Normal'
msg['Importance'] = 'Normal'
msg['MIME-Version'] = '1.0'

# Add unsubscribe header for marketing emails
if opt_in_marketing:
    msg['List-Unsubscribe'] = '<https://astraverify.com/unsubscribe>'
    msg['List-Unsubscribe-Post'] = 'List-Unsubscribe=One-Click'
```

### 2. Improved Email Content
Added context and transparency to email content:

```html
<p style="font-size: 11px; color: #999; margin-top: 20px;">
    This email was sent to {to_email} in response to a security analysis request for {domain}.<br>
    If you did not request this report, please ignore this email.
</p>
```

## Additional Anti-Spam Measures

### 1. Domain Authentication
Ensure your domain has proper email authentication records:

**SPF Record:**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.dreamhost.com ~all
```

**DKIM Record:**
- Configure DKIM signing for astraverify.com
- This helps prove emails are legitimate

**DMARC Record:**
```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@astraverify.com
```

### 2. Email Content Best Practices

**Subject Lines:**
- ✅ Good: "AstraVerify Security Report for example.com"
- ❌ Bad: "URGENT: Your domain is at RISK!"

**Content:**
- ✅ Good: Professional, informative, no excessive punctuation
- ❌ Bad: ALL CAPS, excessive exclamation marks, urgent language

**Links:**
- ✅ Good: Clear, descriptive link text
- ❌ Bad: Generic "Click here" links

### 3. Sending Patterns

**Rate Limiting:**
- Don't send too many emails too quickly
- Implement delays between emails
- Monitor sending rates

**Recipient Management:**
- Only send to users who explicitly request reports
- Provide clear unsubscribe options
- Respect opt-out requests immediately
