# Recommendations and Information Section UI Update

## Overview

Updated the "Security Issues" section to "Recommendations and Information" with a modern, clean design featuring color-coded icons, border-based severity indicators, and right-aligned detail information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Section Rename
- **Before**: "Security Issues"
- **After**: "Recommendations and Information"

### 2. Icon System Update

#### Icon Types and Colors:
- **Informational (ℹ️)**: Blue (#1E90FF) - General information and suggestions
- **Warning/Action Needed (⚠️)**: Orange (#FF9800) - Issues that need attention  
- **OK/Complete (✅)**: Green (#4CAF50) - Completed configurations

#### Icon Styling:
- Circular background with matching colors
- Informational: #BBDEFB background, #1E90FF icon
- Warning: #FFE0B2 background, #FF9800 icon
- Success: #C8E6C9 background, #4CAF50 icon

### 3. Border Approach
- **4px left border** with severity color instead of full box borders

- Hover effects for better interactivity

### 4. Detail Information
- **Right-aligned** impact, effort, and time details

## Visual Design Features

### Color Scheme

## Backend Compatibility

The frontend now gracefully handles recommendations with or without additional detail fields:
- `impact` - Shows impact level and description
- `effort` - Shows effort required
- `estimated_time` - Shows estimated implementation time

If these fields are missing, the detail section is hidden automatically.

Use `test_recommendations_ui.html` to verify:
- All icon types display correctly
- Color coding works as expected
- Detail alignment is properly right-aligned
- Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- Hover effects function properly

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Clear visual distinction between recommendation types
2. **Modern Design**: Clean, professional appearance with proper spacing
3. **Accessibility**: Color-coded borders and icons for better recognition
4. **Responsive**: Works well on all device sizes
5. **Maintainable**: Clear CSS structure and naming conventions
6. **Flexible**: Handles recommendations with or without detail information
