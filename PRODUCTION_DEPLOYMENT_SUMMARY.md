### ⚠️ Temporary Issue: Abuse Detection Blocking

**Issue**: The production environment is currently blocked due to abuse detection system being triggered during testing.

**Details**:
- Block Reason: "High abuse detected: ['suspicious_user_agent']"
- Block Expires: 2025-08-20T07:24:46.437064 (9 hours from deployment)
- Affected: All API endpoints temporarily blocked

**Root Cause**: The abuse detection system is correctly identifying automated testing requests as suspicious behavior, which is actually working as intended for security.
