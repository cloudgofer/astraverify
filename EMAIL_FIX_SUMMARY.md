# Email Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
Production email reports were failing with SMTP authentication errors:
```
(535, b'5.7.8 Error: authentication failed: UGFzc3dvcmQ6')
```

## Root Cause
The `EMAIL_PASSWORD` environment variable was not configured in the Cloud Run services for both production and staging environments.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Production Environment
- **Service**: `astraverify-backend`
- **Region**: `us-central1`
- **Action**: Added `EMAIL_PASSWORD` environment variable
- **Command**: 
  ```bash
  gcloud run services update astraverify-backend --region=us-central1 --set-env-vars="EMAIL_PASSWORD=AVCloudG28#a1"
  ```

### 2. Staging Environment
- **Service**: `astraverify-backend-staging`
- **Region**: `us-central1`
- **Action**: Added `EMAIL_PASSWORD` environment variable
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  gcloud run services update astraverify-backend-staging --region=us-central1 --set-env-vars="EMAIL_PASSWORD=AVCloudG28#a1"
  ```

## Verification

### Production Test
```bash
curl -s "https://astraverify-backend-ml2mhibdvq-uc.a.run.app/api/test-email"
```
**Result**: ✅ Success - Email configuration is working

### Staging Test
```bash
curl -s "https://astraverify-backend-staging-ml2mhibdvq-uc.a.run.app/api/test-email"
```
**Result**: ✅ Success - Email configuration is working

## Current Email Configuration

### SMTP Settings (All Environments)
- **Server**: `smtp.dreamhost.com`
- **Port**: `587`
- **Username**: `hi@astraverify.com`
- **Sender**: `AstraVerify <hi@astraverify.com>`
- **Authentication**: TLS

### Environment Variables
- **Production**: `EMAIL_PASSWORD` set in Cloud Run
- **Staging**: `EMAIL_PASSWORD` set in Cloud Run
- **Local**: `EMAIL_PASSWORD` set as environment variable

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - Email functionality is now working in all environments

## Next Steps
1. Test email report sending from the UI in production
2. Monitor logs for any additional email-related issues
3. Consider moving email password to GCP Secret Manager for enhanced security
